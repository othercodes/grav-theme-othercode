# otherCode Theme

**otherCode** is the main theme for [otherCode Blog](https://othercode.io/).  This theme is built with the 
[Gantry 5](https://gantry.org/) framework and provides a powerful base for developing your own themes. otherCode uses 
functionality that is only available in Grav 1.4+, as such you cannot run otherCode on earlier versions of Grav.

# Installation

Installing the otherCode theme can be done in one of two ways. Our GPM (Grav Package Manager) installation method enables 
you to quickly and easily install the theme with a simple terminal command, while the manual method enables you to do so 
via a zip file.

## GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this theme is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) 
through your system's Terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install othercode

This will install the otherCode theme into your `/user/themes` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under 
`/your/site/grav/user/themes/othercode`.

## Manual Installation

To install this theme, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/themes`. 
Then, rename the folder to `othercode`. You can find these files on [GitHub](https://github.com/othercodes/grav-theme-othercode).

You should now have all the theme files under

    /your/site/grav/user/themes/othercode
